# leetcode_timer

just a repo where I hold different leetcode solutions and try to compare them to each other

If you want to use it just download it and then you can add your solution in the respective impl.py implementation and add it to the SOLUTIONS dictionary at the end of the page.

Have fun comparing your implementations :).
